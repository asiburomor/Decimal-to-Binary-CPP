# Decimal to Binary Converter (C++)

A lightweight command-line tool designed to convert base-10 (Decimal) integers into base-2 (Binary) representation. This project serves as a practical exploration of binary number systems and fundamental C++ programming logic.

## 🚀 Overview
In computer science, understanding how data is represented at the hardware level is crucial. This project was built to explore the relationship between human-readable decimal numbers and the binary language used by computer infrastructure.
## ✨ Features
* **User-Friendly Interface:** Simple CLI prompts for easy interaction.
* **Manual Algorithm:** Uses a purely algorithmic approach (modulo and division) rather than built-in library shortcuts.
* **Error Handling:** Gracefully handles edge cases like the number zero.

## 🛠️ Technical Stack
* **Language:** C++
* **Logic:** Base-conversion algorithm, loop structures, and string manipulation.
* **Development Environment:** [Add your IDE here, e.g., VS Code or Code::Blocks]
